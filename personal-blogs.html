                <h3>1/ Know Your Skin Type</h3>
                <!-- This p tag is used to display more details of the tip -->
                <p>Understanding whether you have oily, dry, combination, or sensitive skin is essential. Choose products formulated for your skin type, as they will address your specific needs more effectively. For example, opt for gel-based products for oily skin and richer creams for dry skin.</p>

                <h3>2/ Look for Multi-Tasking Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and niacinamide are great for various skin concerns. Choosing products with these ingredients can help target multiple issues like hydration, brightness, and texture improvement without having to use too many different products.</p>

                <h3>3/ Patch Test Before Full Use</h3>
                <p>Always do a patch test before introducing a new product into your skincare routine. This helps you avoid potential allergic reactions or irritation, especially for sensitive skin.</p>

    <h2>Makeup Product Selection Tips</h2>
    <p>Finding the right makeup products can elevate your look and help you feel confident. Whether you're a beginner or a makeup enthusiast, it’s important to choose products that match your skin tone, needs, and preferences. In this section, I'll provide you with some simple tips to help you pick makeup that complements your style and skin. From selecting the perfect foundation to choosing long-lasting formulas, these tips will help you build your makeup collection with ease.</p>
        <div class="product-container">
            <div class="product-card">
                <h3>1/ Consider Your Skin Tone</h3>
                <p>When selecting makeup products, consider your skin tone to ensure a seamless match. Choose foundations, concealers, and powders that are close to your natural skin color, and don’t be afraid to test shades before committing to a product.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-card">
                <h3>2/ Look for Non-Comedogenic Products</h3>
                <p>If you're prone to breakouts, opt for non-comedogenic products, which are designed not to clog your pores. This is especially important for foundation and concealer to avoid exacerbating acne or causing new breakouts. Additionally, look for products with ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which can help treat and prevent acne while you wear makeup. Always make sure to properly cleanse your skin at the end of the day to remove any makeup residue and keep your pores clear.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-card">
                <h3>3/ Pick Products with Long-Wear Formulas</h3>
                <p>Long-wear or smudge-proof makeup products can save you time, especially for busy days. Look for products that are waterproof or long-lasting, especially for eyeliner, mascara, and foundation, to avoid touch-ups throughout the day. These products are perfect for ensuring your makeup stays intact even in hot or humid conditions. Investing in long-wear formulas means you can confidently go about your day without worrying about fading or smudging.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-card">
                <h3>4/ Start Simple and Build</h3>
                <p>If you're new to makeup, start with basic products like foundation, mascara, and a lip color that works for everyday use. You can build your collection over time by adding eye shadow, highlighter, and other products as you get more comfortable with different looks. As you become more confident, experiment with different textures and finishes, like matte or dewy, to see what suits your style. Don’t be afraid to try new techniques, and remember that makeup is all about expressing yourself and having fun!</p>

    <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Skincare has always been more than just a routine for me, it’s been a journey of self-discovery, learning to appreciate my skin, and embracing my own natural beauty. Over the years, I’ve struggled with finding products that truly worked for me, tried endless creams, serums, and cleansers, and learned countless lessons along the way. But it wasn’t until I stopped focusing on what I thought I needed and started listening to my skin that I finally found a routine that made a difference. In this section, I’ll share my story and the moments that shaped my skincare routine, hoping to inspire and encourage other women who are navigating their own beauty journeys.</p>
