                <h3>Fast Response Moisturizing Eye Cream with Caffeine</h3>
                <p>Pros: It helps reduce the appearance of puffiness and under-eye bags. Hydrating ingredients combined with caffeine’s circulation-boosting properties can help in preventing fine lines and wrinkles, contributing to a more youthful appearance. It has a lightweight, fast-absorbing texture, which is non-greasy and ideal for sensitive skin around the eyes. I highly recommend it for those who do not get enough sleep. </p>
                <p>Cons: The price is pretty expensive to me</p>

                <h3>Studio Moisture Cream</h3>
                <p>Pros: It provides intense moisture, making it ideal for dry to normal skin types. It leaves skin feeling soft and nourished. Despite being a rich moisturizer, it has a light texture that doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, which makes it a good option for daily wear. In my opinion, It is suitable for most skin types, including sensitive skin, as it doesn’t contain harsh fragrances or ingredients that can irritate. It layers well with other skincare products, and you can easily incorporate it into your routine without it interfering with serums or other treatments.</p>
                <p>Cons: While it’s great for dry to normal skin, those with oily or acne-prone skin may find it a bit too heavy and potentially clogging for their skin type.</p>

        <h2>Glossier</h2>
        <p>I also used some products of glossier. In general, this brand has cute package for every products, but depends on your skin type, the products will or will not fit you!</p>

                <img src="img/glossier2.jpg" alt="Hand Scream">
                <h3>Glossier Invisible Shield - Daily sunscreen SPF 35</h3>
                <p> Pros: It contains moisturizing ingredients, leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth without being heavy or oily. The sunscreen has a sheer, almost invisible finish, leaving little to no white cast, which is especially beneficial for people with deeper skin tones. It works well as a base for makeup, providing a smooth canvas that helps makeup sit well and last longer. In addition to offering broad-spectrum SPF 35 protection, it includes hydrating ingredients like glycerin and antioxidants, offering some additional skincare benefits.</p>
                <p>Cons: While SPF 35 is decent, it’s not as high as some other sunscreens on the market that offer SPF 50+ protection, which might be preferable for those spending a lot of time outdoors. The sunscreen contains a slight fragrance, which could be irritating for those with sensitive skin or fragrance allergies.</p>

                <h3>Milky Jelly Cleanser</h3>
                <p> Pros: The formula is very gentle, making it ideal for all skin types, including sensitive skin. It cleanses without stripping the skin of its natural oils, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated. It works well for removing makeup, including waterproof mascara, without the need for a separate makeup remover. This makes it a convenient, all-in-one cleansing product. The cleanser has a jelly-like consistency that feels luxurious and smooth on the skin.</p>
                <p>Cons: While it does remove light makeup and daily grime, it may struggle with heavy-duty or waterproof makeup. If you wear heavy makeup regularly, you might need a separate remover for more effective cleansing.</p>

                <h3>Glossier Super Glow</h3>
                <p> Pros: Glossier Super Glow contains Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), which helps brighten the skin, even out skin tone, and reduce dullness. It gives your skin a healthy, radiant glow. It works well for most skin types, including dry, oily, and combination skin. The lightweight texture and gentle ingredients make it easy to incorporate into a daily skincare routine.</p>
                <p>Cons: The packaging, while aesthetically pleasing, can sometimes make it tricky to dispense just the right amount of product, and the dropper can be a bit messy or less precise compared to pump dispensers. People with specific skin concerns (such as deeper hyperpigmentation or more severe skin discoloration) might find this product too mild for their needs and might not see dramatic results </p>

        <h2>Sunscreen</h2>
        <p>I like Korean Suncreen, so most of suncreen products are from Korean brand!</p>
        <div class="product-container">

                <img src="img/suncreen5.jpg" alt="Hand Scream">
                <h3>MISSHA All Around Safe Block Essence Sun SPF45 PA++</h3>
                <p> Pros: With SPF 45 and PA++, this sunscreen offers reliable protection from both UVA and UVB rays, helping to prevent sunburn, premature aging, and skin damage. One of the key benefits is that this sunscreen doesn’t leave a white cast, making it a great option for a wide range of skin tones, including medium to dark skin. In addition to sun protection, the product has an essence-like consistency that can provide additional skincare benefits, such as hydration and a smoother skin texture, making it ideal for a streamlined skincare routine. The price is affordable.</p>
                <p>Cons: This sunscreen isn’t water-resistant, so if you’re sweating a lot or swimming, it may not offer the best protection. Reapplication would be necessary after water exposure.</p>

                <h3>Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Air-Fit Suncream Plus, SPF 50+ PA++++</h3>
                <p> Pros: Infused with Centella Asiatica (CICA), known for its healing and soothing properties, this sunscreen helps calm sensitive or irritated skin, making it a great choice for people with reactive skin or conditions like redness or acne. This sunscreen is designed to be non-whitening, meaning it doesn’t leave a white cast, which is a big advantage, especially for those with deeper skin tones. The sunscreen offers long-lasting protection. The product is free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and fragrances, making it suitable for sensitive skin.</p>
                <p>Cons: While the sunscreen is lightweight, individuals with very oily or acne-prone skin may find it slightly too hydrating, which could potentially lead to excess oil production or breakouts.</p>

                <h3>CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Face and Body Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin</h3>
                <p>Pros: I can't live without it, it is my must-have skincare products. Despite its moisturizing properties, the lotion is non-greasy, absorbing quickly into the skin without leaving a heavy or oily residue, which makes it suitable for both face and body. It’s free from fragrances, making it an ideal choice for those with sensitive skin or anyone prone to irritation. It’s formulated to be non-comedogenic, meaning it won’t clog pores, making it a good option for those with acne-prone skin.</p>
                <p>Cons: While the lotion is hydrating, people with extremely dry or cracked skin might need a heavier, richer cream for more intensive hydration. It might not be sufficient during colder, drier months or for those with severe dryness.</p>
