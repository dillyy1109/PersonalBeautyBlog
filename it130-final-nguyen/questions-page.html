        <h4 class="faq-title">1. How do I know my skin type?</h4>
        <p class="faq-text">To determine your skin type, observe how your skin feels throughout the day. If your skin feels tight or dry, you likely have dry skin. If it looks shiny, particularly in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), then you probably have oily skin. Combination skin shows a mix of both, while sensitive skin may react to certain products with redness or irritation. A simple test is to cleanse your face and wait an hour to see how it feels.</p>

        <h4 class="faq-title">2. What’s the best way to apply foundation?</h4>
        <p class="faq-text">The best way to apply foundation is to start with a clean and moisturized face. Use a primer to create a smooth base. Then, apply foundation using a brush, sponge, or your fingers, depending on your preference. For a more natural look, blend it evenly into your skin, focusing on areas where coverage is needed. Remember to set your foundation with powder to keep it in place all day.</p>

        <h4 class="faq-title">3. How often should I change my skincare routine?</h4>
        <p class="faq-text">Your skincare routine should evolve with your skin’s needs, which can change due to factors like seasons, age, and lifestyle. Generally, you don’t need to change your routine frequently, but it’s a good idea to assess your skin every few months. If you’re experiencing new issues like dryness, acne, or sensitivity, it might be time to adjust the products you're using. Always remember to introduce new products gradually and test them for any reactions.</p>

        <h4 class="faq-title">4. Can I mix different skincare products in my routine?</h4>
        <p class="faq-text">Yes, but it's important to be mindful of the products you combine. Some ingredients, like vitamin C and retinol, may not work well together and could cause irritation. Always layer products from thinnest to thickest (e.g., serum before moisturizer). It’s a good idea to research or consult a dermatologist when mixing active ingredients to ensure compatibility for your skin.</p>

        <h4 class="faq-title">5. How do I choose the right skincare products for my skin?</h4>
        <p class="faq-text">Choosing the right skincare products depends on your skin type and concerns. For example, if you have oily skin, look for oil-free or mattifying products, while dry skin can benefit from more hydrating and nourishing formulas. Always pay attention to the ingredients—avoid harsh chemicals if you have sensitive skin and look for calming ingredients like aloe vera. It’s also a good idea to patch-test products before fully incorporating them into your routine.</p>

        <h4 class="faq-title">6. When should I start using anti-aging products?</h4>
        <p class="faq-text">You can start using anti-aging products in your mid-20s to early 30s as a preventive measure. Look for products containing antioxidants like vitamin C, which can help protect your skin from environmental damage. Incorporating retinoids or peptides into your routine after 30 can help maintain skin elasticity and promote collagen production. The key is to find products that match your skin’s needs and to stay consistent with your routine.</p>
