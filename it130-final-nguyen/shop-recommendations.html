                    <h3>Sephora</h3>
                    <!-- The <p> tag is used to display a paragraph of shop review in details. -->
                    <p>Pros: Sephora carries a vast selection of beauty products, including skincare, makeup, fragrances, hair care, and more. They stock a variety of brands, from luxury to drugstore options. Sephora’s staff are often well-trained and can provide helpful advice on choosing the right products for your skin type or personal preferences. They also offer in-store services like makeovers and skin consultations. Sephora carries many exclusive beauty brands that aren’t readily available in other stores. Some brands are Sephora-only, meaning you can only find them at their stores or online. Their loyalty program, Beauty Insider, rewards customers with points for every purchase, offering perks like birthday gifts, exclusive access to sales, and product samples.</p>
                    <p>Cons: Many products at Sephora are on the pricier side, especially when compared to drugstores. High-end and luxury brands can be expensive, making it less budget-friendly for some shoppers.</p>

                    <h3>Ulta Beauty</h3>
                    <p>Pros: Ulta is generally more budget-friendly than Sephora, especially with its selection of drugstore brands. If you're looking for affordable beauty products without compromising on variety, Ulta is a great option. In addition, Ulta has in-store salons that offer haircuts, styling, and beauty services like brow waxing, facials, and more. It can be a convenient option for those looking for a one-stop beauty shop. Lastly, their Ultamate Rewards program offers points for every dollar spent, which can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases. It has different levels based on how much you spend, and you can also earn points for salon services, which adds extra value.</p>
                    <p>Cons: Ulta’s return policy is generally more strict than Sephora’s. If you're trying a new product and it doesn’t work out, you may not be able to return it if it’s been opened or used, depending on the product.</p>

                    <img src="img/YesStyle.jpg" alt="Shop 3">
                    <h3>YesStyle</h3>
                    <p>Pros: YesStyle is a go-to destination for Korean beauty (K-beauty) products, which are often highly sought after for their quality and innovation. It carries a range of popular brands that might be hard to find elsewhere. YesStyle regularly has discounts, sales, and promotional events. You can also find special deals like “buy more, save more” or seasonal offers that make shopping more affordable. In addition to beauty products, YesStyle carries a wide range of fashion, accessories, home goods, and wellness items. If you're looking for a one-stop-shop for all things trendy and stylish, it’s a convenient platform.</p>
                    <p>Cons: You have to wait for such a long time for international shipment. YesStyle’s return policy can be more complicated than some other retailers. While they do accept returns for some products, there are certain conditions (e.g., unopened items) that may limit your ability to return or exchange. Shipping costs for returns are typically the buyer’s responsibility, which can be inconvenient.</p>
